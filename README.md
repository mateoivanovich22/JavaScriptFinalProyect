On this website, we worked with all kinds of variables and functions seen throughout the Coderhouse course (JavaScript). We used the mockapi API with the use of 2 endpoints: users and questions.

The website has 4 sections: "Home," "Hire," "Contact," and "My Insurance."

Endpoint users: Users can create an account from the "Hire" section. It is designed so that only those who acquire the service can create an account. If you haven't acquired the service, you won't be able to create an account.

Endpoint questions: Users can make inquiries from the "Contact" section.

If you have an account, meaning you acquired the service, you can access a section called "Insurance Status" where we will show you the status of your insurance and where you can modify the number of insurances if desired. If you are not a user or have not logged in, you won't be able to access this section.

Hope you like it!
